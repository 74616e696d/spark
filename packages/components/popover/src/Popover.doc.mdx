# Popover

Displays rich content in a portal, triggered by a button.

## Install

```sh
npm install @spark-ui/popover
```

## Import

```tsx
import { Popover } from '@spark-ui/popover'
```

## Props

<ArgTypes
  of={Popover}
  subcomponents={{
    'Popover.Trigger': Popover.Trigger,
    'Popover.Content': Popover.Content,
    'Popover.Anchor': Popover.Anchor,
  }}
/>

## Default

A basic popover should have a trigger element and a content element.

The trigger is the element that should toggle the popover.
The content is the popover itself.

<Canvas of={stories.Default} />

## Controlled

You can use state to have better control over the behaviour of the Popover.
It allows you to open/close it from the outside.

Please note that is example is using `Popover.Anchor` to attach the Popover to a specific element.

<Canvas of={stories.Controlled} />

## Anchored

When you need to attach the popover to a different element than its `Popover.Trigger`, you must use `Popover.Anchor`.

If not used, then `Popover.Trigger` will be both the trigger element and the anchor for the popover.

When using `Popover.Anchor`, you can have multiple `Popover.Trigger` to trigger the same `Popover` in different ways

<Canvas of={stories.Anchored} />

## Match trigger width

Use this prop to make the Popover width match its trigger element width.

<Canvas of={stories.MatchTriggerWidth} />

## Boundaries

You can restrict the popover to stay inside a container (ref).
In this example, the Popover remains inside the grey container.

**Please note that it applies only to the width of the popover, to prevent the popover content from overflowing.**

<Canvas of={stories.Boundaries} />

## Positionning

<Canvas of={stories.Positionning} />
