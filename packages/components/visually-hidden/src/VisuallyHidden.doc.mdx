# VisuallyHidden

Hides content from the screen in an accessible way.
`VisuallyHidden` hides content from visual client, but keep it readable for screen readers.
It is useful in certain scenarios as an alternative to traditional labelling with aria-label or aria-labelledby and it is the logical opposite of the aria-hidden attribute.

<StoryHeading label="Install" />

```
npm install @spark-ui/visually-hidden
```

<StoryHeading label="Import" />

```
import { VisuallyHidden } from "@spark-ui/visually-hidden"
```

<StoryHeading label="Default" />

A button without text can be absolutely mysterious for someone using screen reader. They might be announced simply as "button". We can solve this problem without compromising on our design. A VisuallyHidden component will allow us to place text inside this button that will only be made available to people using screen readers.
