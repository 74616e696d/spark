# Portal

Renders a React subtree in a different part of the DOM.

- Render any React subtree outside of your App.
- Appends to `document.body` by default but can be customized to use a different container.

<StoryHeading label="Install" />

```
npm install @spark-ui/portal
```

<StoryHeading label="Import" />

```
import { Portal } from "@spark-ui/portal"
```

<StoryHeading label="Props" />

<ArgsTable of={Portal} />

<StoryHeading label="Usage" />

In the following example, the JSX element is located in the left block, but rendered inside the right block.

This is because we wrapped it with a `Portal` whose `container` is the block to the right.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={PortalStories.Usage} />
</Canvas>
