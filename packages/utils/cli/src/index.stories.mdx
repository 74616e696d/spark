# CLI utils

This package provides some CLI commands to improve the development experience when building the Spark design system. Right now there are some different commands available:

- A command for generating new components: `$ spark generate`.
- A command for doing the initial setup for a new theme: `$ spark setup-theme`.

CLI utils can be used by installing the package `@spark-ui/cli-utils` in your `package.json`:

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev @spark-ui/cli-utils
```

or just by running the following command:

```bash
$ npx spark COMMAND_NAME
```

<StoryHeading label="Generating a new package" as="h2" />

In order to generate a new package, the following command has to be executed:

```bash
$ spark generate
```

Then, a command prompt will guide you through the process by asking you for:

- the package name (required),
- the template used (required, only `Component` template available right now)
- and the package description (optional).
