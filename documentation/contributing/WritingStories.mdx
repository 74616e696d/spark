# Writing stories

Write your stories using the [MDX format](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/api/mdx). It allows for more flexibility and automatically generates a Docs page for your component.

The official recipe we follow for now is [CSF Stories with MDX Docs](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/code/addons/docs/docs/recipes.md#csf-stories-with-mdx-docs)

</Alert>

Each component documentation should follow this structure:

1. [Meta](#meta)
2. [Description](#description)
3. [Anatomy](#anatomy)
4. [ArgsTable](#argstable)
5. [Variants and examples](#variants-and-examples)

<StoryHeading label="Meta" />

The component documentation should be placed under the `Components` section of the documentation.

They must belong to one of the following categories:

- Disclosure
- Feedback
- Overlay
- Layout
- Media and Icons
- Navigation
- Forms
- Data Display
- Typography

> Example:

```
import { Meta } from "@storybook/addon-docs";

<Meta title="Components/Forms/Button" component={Button} />
```

<StoryHeading label="Description" />

Using markdown syntax, describe what your component's role is. Try to be concise and clear.

For example, for a `Button` component, it could be:

> Button component is used to trigger an action or event, such as submitting a form, opening a Dialog, canceling an action, or performing a delete operation.

<StoryHeading label="Anatomy" />

todo

<StoryHeading label="ArgsTable" />

Simply use Storybook's `ArgsTable` component in your MDX to generate the props documentation.
It will parse the TypeScript files of your component to generate a full table.

It uses the JSDoc comments above each prop of your component to show it as a description. It also retrieves default values for each property.

```
import { ArgsTable } from "@storybook/addon-docs";

## Props

<ArgsTable of={Button} />
```

**Here is what the ArgsTable looks like for a simple component:**

<img width={800} src={ArgstableImg} alt="Argstable shows a table of the component's props" />

<StoryHeading label="Variants and examples" />

Display and describe as many use cases as you want to showcase the features offered by your component.
We [suggest you split JSX examples from the markdown](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/code/addons/docs/docs/recipes.md#csf-stories-with-mdx-docs) for a better developer experience because TypeScript does not support MDX type-checking as of today.

###

<StoryHeading label="Live editable example" as="h3" />

We created `@devtools/ReactLiveBlock` to replace the `Canvas` component offered by Storybook.
`ReactLiveBlock` allows you to display editable JSX of your stories, copy the code or reset it to its initial state.

Simply create examples like this:

```
import { Button } from "./Button";
import { ReactLiveBlock } from "@devtools/ReactLiveBlock";

export const variants = () => (
  <ReactLiveBlock scope={{ Button }}>
    <Button variant="default" label="Default" />
    <Button variant="warning" label="Warning" />
    <Button variant="danger" label="Danger" />
    <Button variant="info" label="Info" />
    <Button variant="success" label="Success" />
  </ReactLiveBlock>
);

export const sizes = () => (
  <ReactLiveBlock scope={{ Button }}>
    <Button size="small" label="Button (small)" />
    <Button size="medium" label="Button (medium)" />
    <Button size="large" label="Button (large)" />
  </ReactLiveBlock>
);
```

Then consume it in your MDX file:

```
import * as examples from "./ButtonExamples";

## Variants

Some description about the variants and their semantic roles...

<Story name="variants" story={examples.variants} />

## Sizes

Some description about the sizes...

<Story name="sizes" story={examples.sizes} />
```

Feel free to add as many examples as necessary.
