<StoryHeading label="Migrating from styled-components" as="h1" />

If you've recently switched from using **styled-components** to **Spark** for styling your application.

This guide can help you understand how to adapt your styling workflow to Spark, showing you how to achieve the same styling results with Spark that you had with styled-components.

  It's important to note that the tokens used in these examples are for illustrative purposes and

- before

```tsx
export const StyledNad = styled('nav')(({ theme }) => ({
  display: 'flex',
  maxWidth: theme.pageWidth.max,
  margin: '0 auto',
  padding: `0 ${theme.space.medium}`,
}))

function SomeComponent() {
  return <StyledNav>{...}</StyledNav>
}
```

- after

```tsx
function SomeComponent() {
  return <nav className="flex max-w-max mx-auto px-m">{...}</nav>
}
```

⬆️ The class names used in the example code are **regular Tailwind CSS classes**, and you can refer to
the Tailwind documentation for more information on their usage.

However, **Spark** uses a custom theme, so the suffixes for **tokens** such as spacings, colors, etc., may not match the default Tailwind theme. For example, instead of using `m-4` for a margin of 16 pixels, you will have to use `m-m` in Spark.

<Alert>
  If you want to know more about the custom token class names used in Spark, please check out our
  dedicated page where you can find a comprehensive list of these class names.
